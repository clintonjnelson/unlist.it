  %ol
    %li
      Think of a bunch of stuff you're looking to buy. Now pick 2 and let's get started.
      %br These will be your first two unlistings (wanted ads / wishlist items) on your unlist (wishlist).
    %br
    %li
      Start Adding Unlistings - one for each of the two items
      %br
      %em (When signed in, this is found under the Unlist tab => "+add unlisting")
      %br
    %li
      Search & add your friends/family for following their unlists (wishlists)
      %br
      %em (When signed in, this is found under the Unlist tab => "friends")
  %br
  %p You now know the basics. Remember that keywords in your unlistings are what will be searched for. Also, adding a link to your unlisting enables you to conveniently choose a picture for display. Have fun!
