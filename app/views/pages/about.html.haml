  %p I'm not a mega-corporation pumping out software by the droves, I'm just a simple family-man with beautiful wife & daughter who thinks it should be less work to connect buyers & sellers. With lots of grace from Jesus, I decided to learn how to code web applications so I could build Unlist.it and make finding things a whole lot easier.

  %p Thanks & happy unlist-ing.
