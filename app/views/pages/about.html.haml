  %h4.text-muted About Unlist.it
  %p Unlist.it is about "wishlist classifieds" - local classifieds where BUYERS(unlisters) create a wishlist of things they want. Our unlisters can be looking for anything (anything legal, that is) and from anywhere. Instead of buyers doing the searching, SELLERS (who have stuff) do the searching to find ads (unlistings) by those who want it. Sellers can then contact the buyer(unlister) to sell them the desired item. This helps buyers avoid hours of searching, and sellers can quickly find buyers without managing ads. Unlist.it provides quick, easy, and direct connections between buyers and sellers. As you use Unlist.it, you'll start to see the potential for creating a more-convenient & more sustainable society.
  %p You'll probably also see that Unlists are like wishlists (think Christmas) that can be used year-round to find out what your friends & family are looking for. This is extremely helpful for finding the perfect gift!

  %h4.text-muted About Me (the founder of Unlist.it)
  %p I'm a serial hobbist, an aspiring programmer, a follower of Jesus, and a husband/father who was frustrated by the lack of approaches to find & buy stuff locally. I was spending hours --that I don't have-- trying to find things that I HOPED someone would list for sale. Online classifieds seem like a 1-way street, so after other people shared my frustrations, I decided to create the other side of the street - a site where BUYERS make a wishlist of what they want to BUY. I'm a Civil Engineer by day, so I took a year of nights/weekeends to learn programming, and have built Unlist.it with what I learned. I hope you will find Unlist.it to be a useful resource for giving & getting, a promoter of local community, a step towards sustainable living, and an alleviator of frustrations for us buyers(unlisters) everywhere.

  %p Thanks & happy unlist-ing.
