  // FAQ #3
  %h3#q3
    What is an Unlist good for?
  %ul
    %li.list-no-bullet
      %h5 Announcing to the world that you want something.
    %ul
      %li.list-no-bullet
        This enables others to sell their stuff to you.
    %li.list-no-bullet
      %h5 Helping friends & family have an easier time knowing what you want.
    %ul
      %li.list-no-bullet
        This simplifies & de-stresses the process of getting you a gift, since others can quickly & confidently find a perfect gift idea for you.
    %li.list-no-bullet
      %h5 Promoting a more sustainable world by community sharing.
    %ul
      %li.list-no-bullet
        This helps community reuser's find you & pass on their stuff, or vice-versa.
      %li.list-no-bullet
        Cheap items in the past has not been worth the hassle to post & manage, so we've thrown lots of stuff away. Sad. Search the unlistings to see instantly if anyone is interested in your stuff & can contact them immediately. Win.

    %li.list-no-bullet
      %h5 Finding rare or specific items
    %ul
      %li.list-no-bullet If you want rare, hard-to-find, or odd things, your unlistings will work to help your interest-to-buy be known. When someone with that item is thinking about selling, they can find you.
      %li.list-no-bullet The hassle of sellers maintaining an ad for a rarely sought-after item is too much work, so Unlist lets the buyers put their interest out for sellers to search for. Less work for sellers & a higher chance of unlisters(buyers) finding that item.

  // FAQ #4
  %h3#q4
    What is "Community Reuse" (aka: "ReUse")?
  %ul
    %li.list-no-bullet Community Reuse is a way of helping others & the environment by giving away things you no longer want or need.
    %br
    %li.list-no-bullet This promotes community and sustainability at a local and global level. You can find more information on the global movement by searching online for "Community Reuse". The "Buy Nothing" or "Trash Backwards" project is a great example of this movement that was started on Bainbridge Island, WA (a ferry ride from Seattle).
    %br
    %li.list-no-bullet Unlist.it also hopes to help foster this type of movement in local communities. You can create a Community Reuse unlisting by putting a zero in for the price. So, before you throw away usable items (yes, even paper bags, wine bottles, fruit tree produce, the list goes on...), do a quick local search and see if you can help a neighbor and reduce the load on our landfills.

  // FAQ #9
  %h3#q9
    Can I make unlistings to SELL things on Unlist.it?
  %ul
    %li.list-no-bullet
      %h5 No.
      %ul
        %li.list-no-bullet
          Sorry, Unlist.it unlistings are BUY ads ONLY. If you'd like to make ads to sell things, there are already lots of sites for that. Such as:
          %span
            =link_to 'Craigslist', 'http://www.craigslist.org', target: '_blank'
            and
            =link_to 'eBay', 'http://www.ebay.com', target: '_blank'
        %br
        %li.list-no-bullet
        Here is how SELLERS should use this website: Search for items that you HAVE & want to sell. If you (the SELLER) search & find an unlisting precisely describing the item you are selling, you can contact the unlister who made the unlisting & offer to sell them the item.

  // FAQ #10
  %h3#q10
    Can people see my email address when contacting me on unlistings? How do they contact me?
  %ul
    %li.list-no-bullet
      %h5 Full User Accounts
      %ul
        %li.list-no-bullet
          No, we keep your email address internal to our systems. You receive unlist messages when people contact you, and we will send you a notification of this new message to your email. This way, the person who contacts you doesn't need to know your email. When you contact other users, it just sends them an unlist message from you.
        %br
      %h5 Safeguest Accounts
      %ul
        %li.list-no-bullet
          Yes, your email is sent to the user you contact. It shows up in their messages inbox, and they can then use it to contact you from their email.
        %br
        %li.list-no-bullet
          If you prefer to keep your email anonymous when contacting users, you can sign up for a full Unlist account and then we won't need to send your email address for contact.
