You've Been Cordially Invited to Join Unlist.it


Unlist.it is a growing community of people engaging sustainable-living through a faster, less-hassle version of community classifieds.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<%="You should feel lucky - #{@user.username} has a limited number of invitations, and decided you are worthy of one!"%>

Unlist.it is currently in beta-testing and by-invitation-ONLY. With this invitation link, you can be one of the early-users to join and get in early on the action:

<%= link_to "Join Unlist.it", register_with_invite_url(@invitation.token) %>
Or paste this link into your browser:
<%= link_to "#{register_with_invite_url(@invitation.token)}", register_with_invite_url(@invitation.token) %>


  For buyers, Unlist.it was created to be
    Convenient - no wasted hours searching - sellers find you
    Local - connect with real people
    Safe - meet at a public indoor location (great excuse for some coffee)

  For Sellers, Unlist.it was created to
    Informative - discover interest level & prices
    Efficient - find buyers quickly
    Free - no cost to join or sell


Unlist.it turns community classifieds upside-down --- sellers search for buyers and everyone wins.

We hope you find Unlist.it a valuable resource, a more-sustainable solution, and a conversation-piece.



Enjoy,
Clint Nelson, Founder of Unlist.it
