You've Been Cordially Invited to Join Unlist


UUnlist is based around a creative new idea of "wishlist classifieds" - a wishlist where each item acts like a local wanted-ad. We're a community engaged in sustainable-living through time-thrifty, local, wishlist classifieds.

They have also sent you a personal note: "<%= "#{ @invitation.note }" %>"
(if you don't recognize their name & it has the form "UnlisterXXXXXXXX", you can remind them that they may want to update their username in thier profile!)
<% end %>



To sign up, visit unlist.it or click the following link:
  <%= register_with_invite_url(@invitation.token) %>



You'll soon be posting ads(unlistings) of what you're looking for. Unlist turns community classifieds upside-down --- sellers search for buyers and everyone wins.



Enjoy,
Clint Nelson, Founder of Unlist.it
