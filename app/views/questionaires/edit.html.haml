    %h4.text-muted Unlist.it BETA
    %p Thanks for your help with our project! Unlist.it has come a long way through your use and your feedback, and has finally reached our BETA release. This means we still have a long list of features that will be added as we go, but that we have now opened up the site for everyone. Come one, come all!

    %h4.text-muted Upcoming Features
    %p Unlist.it is still "in the works", but here are some of my plans for it.
    %ul
      %li Flagging Users, Messages, & Unlistings that are: spam, duplicates, not allowed, etc.
      %li
        Blocking Specific Users:
        %ul
          %li Don't like some guy contacting you? Block him for good.
          %li Don't want to see that user's unlistings? Block them from showing up on your searches.
      %li Search Options (by EXACT keyword phrase, title-only, description, only Community Reuse, etc. Currently by title/keyword.)
      %li And more...
